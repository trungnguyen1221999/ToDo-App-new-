## Project Review 🧐

- First time using **TypeScript** in a React project; initially easy to follow but relatively challenging in practice  
- Learned how to use TypeScript for defining types, props, and state  
- Learned how to save and render data from **Local Storage** in React  
- Improved skills in using **Vite** as a build tool for React  
- Initially, I thought this project would be very simple because I had previously built a Todo App (with fewer features) using only HTML, CSS, and JS  
- However, using new technologies like **TypeScript** and **React** made it relatively more challenging this time  
- ⚠️ Realized that I need more practice: this project involved a lot of coding and my lack of analytical thinking at the beginning made the code messy and unstructured  
- 🏋️‍♂️ Probably need to train more with applications like this to improve structuring and planning skills
