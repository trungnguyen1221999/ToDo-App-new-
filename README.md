## Project Review

- First time using **TypeScript** in a React project; initially easy to follow but relatively challenging in practice.  
- Learned how to use TypeScript for defining types, props, and state.  
- Learned how to save and render data from **Local Storage** in React.  
- Improved skills in using **Vite** as a build tool for React.
