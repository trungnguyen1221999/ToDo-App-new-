## Project Description

This is a simple Todo App that allows users to manage their personal tasks with the following features:

- ➕ Add new tasks  
- ✏️ Edit existing tasks  
- 🗑️ Delete tasks  
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed  
- ❌ Mark tasks as incomplete  
- 💾 All data is stored in **Local Storage** to preserve the state after page reload

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- TypeScript  
- React  
- Vite  
- Styled-components (for styling)  
- React-icons (for edit and delete icons)  
- Local Storage (for saving todo state)  

The app is deployed on **Netlify**.

## Project Review 🧐

- First time using **TypeScript** in a React project; initially easy to follow but relatively challenging in practice  
- Learned how to use TypeScript for defining types, props, and state  
- Learned how to save and render data from **Local Storage** in React  
- Improved skills in using **Vite** as a build tool for React  
- Initially, I thought this project would be very simple because I had previously built a Todo App (with fewer features) using only HTML, CSS, and JS  
- However, using new technologies like **TypeScript** and **React** made it relatively more challenging this time  
- 🏋️‍♂️ Probably need to train more with applications like this to improve structuring and planning skills

## Update 🔄

I created another Todo App afterward, and this time it was **much easier and faster** to implement.
